/**
 * A class that was created to contain multiple #Paging objects. Because a search request may
 * contain multiple types of data (such as tracks, artists, albums, etc.), the root of the
 * JSON response will contain a paging object for each type of data that was requested. Even
 * if a single type of data is requested, the root of the JSON response will change depending
 * on what type of data is requested. For example, if tracks are requested, then the root
 * will contain a key called "tracks". However, if artists are searched for, then the root
 * of the JSON will contain a key called "artists". However, it will not contain a "tracks"
 * key since that is not what was searched for. If both tracks and artists were included in
 * the search, then both keys will be present.
