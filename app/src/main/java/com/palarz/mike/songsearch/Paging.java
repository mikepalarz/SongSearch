/**
 * A class which represents a Paging object from the Spotify Web API:
 *
 * https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/object-model/#paging-object
 *
 * It is an offset-based paging object that is a container for the requested data. For my
 * implementation, I've considered this to be a super-class. For every search request that is
 * made, there can be multiple paging objects which are returned. For example, Spotify
 * search request can search for both artists and tracks:
 *
 * https://api.spotify.com/v1/search?type=track,artist
 *
 * In this case, 2 paging objects will be returned: a paging object under the key "tracks"
 * and another with the key "artists". Each paging object will contain the same key/value
 * pairs: "href", "limit", "next", "previous", "total", and "items". The main difference is what's
 * contained within the "items" key. For the "tracks" paging object, "items" will contain track
 * objects and likewise for the "artists" paging object. For this reason, a PagingTracks subclass
 * has been made so that the "items" key is handled appropriately for track objects.
 *
 * For the time being, search requests are only being made for track objects. However, in
 * the future, artists requests will also be made. In that case, an ArtistsPaging class will
 * also be created.
 *
 * Even if multiple types aren't specified in the query of the HTTP request, the "items" key will
 * contain different data depending on what was specified in the type query.
